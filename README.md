### A symbol for art following the peace sign design principles

# Design

The design of the art symbol is related to that of the [peace sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_symbols) in that both derive their meaning from [flag semaphore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_semaphore). As the peace sign's meaning is based on the nuclear disarmament movement - the sign is the superimposition of N and D in flag semaphore for nuclear disarmament - the art symbol is the superimposition of A, R and T. The T of the symbol is offset to the right of its natural position to create two arrows.

# Meaning

Possible meanings behind the art symbol include but are not limited to:

- The arrows represent art's ability to both cut to the center of issues as well as push their boundaries
- The square around the arrows represents the social constructs in which art always takes place
- The offsetting of T represents art's habit of breaking rules to create works that are aesthetically appealing
- That the symbol could also be read as "rat" represents the varied interpretations of every artistic piece
